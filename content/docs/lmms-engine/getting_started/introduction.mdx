# Introduction
LMMs Engine is a flexible and extensible framework designed for training large multimodal models. It provides:

- **Modular Architecture**: Built on factory patterns, making it easy to extend with custom components
- **Flexible Training**: Support for various model architectures, datasets, and training strategies
- **Configuration-Driven**: Lightweight framework with configuration-based component building
- **Video Support**: Native support for video processing with multiple backend options
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large-scale training with performance optimization

## Getting Started
To begin using LMMs Engine, proceed to the [quick_start](quick_start) guide or explore the [index](../user_guide/index) for detailed information about specific features.

## Key Concepts
- **Factory Pattern**: Used to encapsulate component creation for models, trainers, datasets, and processors
- **Builder Pattern**: Lazy initialization of components, loading them only when needed
- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for future extensibility

For more details about the architecture, see the [design_principle](../reference/design_principle).
